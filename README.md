## Introduction
Many people use to-do lists to manage their daily tasks. This digital to-do app was created as an alternative to the analog lists. It allows a user to set his/her main goal as well as sort tasks into different groups (work, personal and home).

The purpose of this project was to create a useful website using nothing but HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My main goal with this project was to learn and practice manipulation of the DOM with plain JavaScript as well as to get more practice with its fundamentals and my secondary goal was to practice designing websites. I have successfully completed both of these goals.

Currently there is no way of saving the list so an important feature that should be added in the future is some way of saving the list and making it accessible again when the user reloads the page or reopens the browser.

## Technologies

## How to Use this Project
This is a fully functional web app, so you may use it for managing your daily tasks if you wish.
Go to the [to-do list app](https://amadejaop.github.io/todo-list/todo.html).

### Description
The app opens with a title and today's date at the top of the page. The main goal for the day is shown below along with the start over button underneath. Under this header there are three sections available for you to add tasks into. These help you sort your tasks into work, personal and home tasks.

### Setting the main goal
The main goal of the day is the most important task you absolutely must complete today. It is visible in bold letters in the header of the page, so that you can easily see it and be reminded of it throughout the day.
Write the task in the field and click _set goal_ or press _enter_. The task is visible in bold letters next to the "Main goal for the day:" text.
If you have made a typo or want to change your main goal, you may do so by clicking the _change goal_ button.

### Starting over
The start over button allows you to clear the entire page and start over. This is useful in cases when you have completed most/all of the tasks and want to add more, because the amount of tasks you may add is limited. **Any tasks not yet completed will also be deleted, so use this button with caution.**

### Tasks
You may sort your tasks into sections called work, personal and home. The amount of tasks in each of these sections is limited to 10. Make sure your tasks are specific and can be completed in a short period of time. Examples of well-defined tasks are: create a pie chart for project A, call for a dental check-up, pay electricity bill,...

#### Adding tasks
To add a task, click on the field in the appropriate section (work, personal or home) to write down the task, then click _add task_ or press _enter_.

#### Finishing tasks
Click on the text of the task or its checkbox on the left to mark the task as complete. Completed tasks will have a check mark in the checkbox and the task text will turn strikethrough gray. 

#### Deleting tasks
When you add a task, a delete button will appear next to it. Clicking on the delete button will delete the task and allow you to add a task again. Use this button in case you made a typo or realized the task is not specific enough.
